# Assistant UI Starter (Assistant Cloud + Clerk)

This is the [assistant-ui](https://assistant-ui.com) starter project with [Assistant Cloud](https://cloud.assistant-ui.com) integration and [Clerk](https://clerk.com) for authentication.

## Getting Started

### 1. Set up Assistant Cloud

1. Sign up for Assistant Cloud at [cloud.assistant-ui.com](https://cloud.assistant-ui.com)
2. Create a new project in your Assistant Cloud dashboard
3. Navigate to your project settings to get:
   - Your Assistant Cloud API URL

1. Go to the Clerk dashboard and under "Configure" tab, "JWT Templates" section, create a new template. Choose a blank template and name it "assistant-ui".

2. As the "Claims" field, enter the following:

```json
{
  "aud": "assistant-ui"
}
```

> **Note:** The aud claim ensures that the JWT is only valid for the assistant-ui API.

3. You can leave everything else as default. Take note of the "Issuer" and "JWKS Endpoint" fields.
4. In the assistant-cloud dashboard settings, navigate to the "Auth Rules" tab and create a new rule.
5. Choose "Clerk" and enter the Issuer and JWKS Endpoint from the previous step. As the "Audience" field, enter "assistant-ui".
