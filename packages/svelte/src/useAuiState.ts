/**
 * Subscribes to a slice of `AssistantState` and returns it behind a reactive
 * `current` getter.
 *
 * Reads the surrounding provider's scopes by default (call during component
 * initialization); pass `item` (a per-item handle such as a `MessageItem`
 * from `threadMessages`) to read that item's scopes instead, from anywhere.
 *
 * Reading `current` inside an effect or template tracks the store: the read
 * re-runs when the selected slice changes by `Object.is`, so a store update
 * that does not move the slice wakes nothing. The `selector` runs per store
 * notification and on each read; returning the entire state object is not
 * supported and throws. Select a specific field instead, or compose multiple
 * `useAuiState` calls. Returning a fresh object or array literal defeats the
 * deduplication; select primitives or a memoized reference.
 *
 * Scopes that may be unavailable can be read via `s.optional.<scope>`, which
 * resolves to `undefined` instead of throwing.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const isRunning = useAuiState((s) => s.thread.isRunning);
 * // template: <button disabled={isRunning.current}>…</button>
 * ```
