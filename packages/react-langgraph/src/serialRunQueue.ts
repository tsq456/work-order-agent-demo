/**
 * Serialize runs so at most one is in flight at a time. A payload enqueued
 * while a run is active waits for it to settle; each enqueue resolves once its
 * own run completes.
 *
 * `run` receives an `onComplete` callback to invoke atomically with its final
 * state flush; the queue reports `onRunningChange(false)` through it only when
 * nothing else is queued, so back-to-back runs form one continuous running
 * window. `onRunningChange` fires on transitions only.
 *
 * A run that rejects drops the payloads queued behind it (their promises
 * reject) and rejects its own promise. `drop()` does the same for everything
 * not yet started, leaving an active run untouched.
