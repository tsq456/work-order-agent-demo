1. Check components.json. If it has no "@assistant-ui" registry, add \`"@assistant-ui": "https://r.assistant-ui.com/styles/{style}/{name}.json"\` under "registries". If components.json is missing, run \`npx shadcn@latest init --defaults --yes\` first.
2. Run \`npx shadcn@latest add @assistant-ui/${registryItem} --yes\`.
3. Read the "With a runtime" part of the docs page above and render ${title} where it says, inside the existing AssistantRuntimeProvider. Reuse the project's thread and composer; do not add a second one.

Verify: start the dev server, open the page that renders the thread, and confirm ${title} appears and responds to the runtime state the docs describe.`;

1. Check components.json. If it has no "@assistant-ui" registry, add \`"@assistant-ui": "https://r.assistant-ui.com/styles/{style}/{name}.json"\` under "registries". If components.json is missing, run \`npx shadcn@latest init --defaults --yes\` first.
2. Run \`npx shadcn@latest add @assistant-ui/${registryItem} --yes\`.
3. Ask the user where ${title} should appear if the project does not make it obvious, then render it there with the props the docs page above lists. Feed it the project's real data; use the docs' sample data only when none exists yet, and say so.

Verify: start the dev server, open the page that renders ${title}, and confirm it shows without console errors.`;
